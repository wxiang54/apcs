=== A1: Introduction to digital pictures and color ===

1. How many bits does it take to represent the values from 0 to 255?
	A: 8 bits (11111111 B2 = 255 B10, 00000000 B2 = 0 B10)
	
2. How many bytes does it take to represent a color in the RGB color model?
	A: 3 bytes; 24 bits (3 values in range 0-255)
	
3. How many pixels are in a picture that is 640 pixels wide and 480 pixels high?
	A: 307200 pixels (640px * 480px)
	
	
	
=== A2: Picking a color ===

1. How can you make pink?
	A: RGB 255,153,203
	
2. How can you make yellow?
	A: RGB 255,255,0
	
3. How can you make purple?
	A: RGB 102,0,204
	
4. How can you make white?
	A: RGB 255,255,255
	
5. How can you make dark gray?
	A: RGB 64,64,64
	
	
	
=== A3: Exploring a picture ===

1. What is the row index for the top left corner of the picture?
	A: Row 0
2. What is the column index for the top left corner of the picture?
	A: Column 0
3. The width of this picture is 640. What is the right most column index?
	A: Column 639
4. The height of this picture is 480. What is the bottom most row index?
	A: Row 479
5. Does the row index increase from left to right or top to bottom?
	A: Top to bottom
6. Does the column index increase from left to right or top to bottom?
	A: Left to right
7. Set the zoom to 500%. Can you see squares of color? This is called pixelation. Pixelation means
displaying a picture so magnified that the individual pixels look like small squares. 
	A: Ye ezpz


	
=== A4: Two-dimensional arrays in Java ===



=== A5: Modifying a picture ===

1. Open Picture.java and look for the method getPixels2D. Is it there?
	A: Nope fk
	
2. Open SimplePicture.java and look for the method getPixels2D. Is it there?
	A: Ye ez
	
3. Does the following code compile? 
 DigitalPicture p = new DigitalPicture();
	A: Yes, object type DigitalPicture = var type DigitalPicture is obviously OK
	
4. Assuming that a no-argument constructor exists for SimplePicture, would the following
code compile?
 DigitalPicture p = new SimplePicture();
	A: Yes, obj type SimplePicture inherits var type DigitalPicture

5. Assuming that a no-argument constructor exists for Picture, does the following code
compile?
 DigitalPicture p = new Picture();
	A: Yes, obj type Picture inherits var type DigitalPicture

6. Assuming that a no-argument constructor exists for Picture, does the following code
compile?
 SimplePicture p = new Picture();
	A: Yes, obj type Picture inherits var type SimplePicture
	
7. Assuming that a no-argument constructor exists for SimplePicture, does the following
code compile?
 Picture p = new SimplePicture();
	A: No, obj type SimplePicture does not inherit var type Picture
	
 
 
=== A6: Mirroring pictures ===
